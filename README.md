## Papers 

### 1. [Drone View Segmentation: Deep Learning and Transfer Insights](https://ijisae.org/index.php/IJISAE/article/view/4393)
- **Authors:** Vivek Gurve, Gunjan Singh, Dr. Shilpa Gite, Dr. K. Nandhini, Santosh Borde
- **Abstract:**  This project focuses on the development and application of Deep Learning techniques for Aerial Image Transfer Learning and Segmentation. Leveraging a UNet-based deep learning model with preconfigured weights, the main goal is to obtain high-quality aerial image segmentation, especially for drone-captured photos, for a range of applications including infrastructure evaluation and environmental monitoring. Semantic Drone Data set is a carefully chosen source data set of high quality Drone Aerial Images and matching masks is used to train model. Transfer learning is employ on the target dataset to adapt the model for segmentation tasks in a simulated environment with QGroundControl, PX4Autopilot, and the Gazebo simulator. This simulation-based approach enables the evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance in various scenarios, enhancing its robustness and generalization capabilities. Additionally, the 
generation of a self-captured data set through the simulation environment, emphasizes the integration of synthetic data into the pipeline. The outcome of this project not only contributes to advancing image segmentation in drone-based applications but also explores the effectiveness of Transfer Learning in adapting models to novel environments, fostering advancements in the broader field of computer vision for Unmanned Aerial Systems.

### 2. [Design and Fabrication of 3-RPS Robot - Rack and Pinion Mechanism](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9544519)
- **Authors:** Himanshu V Vairagade, Vivek Gurve, Neema Amish Ukani, Sandeep Sonaskar, Saurabh S. Chakole
- **Abstract:** Parallel Manipulator is one of the trending research topics in the field of robotics. Recently, the 3-RPS parallel manipulator is widely being used for novel applications. Conventionally, the prismatic actuation is implemented using pneumatic drives. In this paper, a rack and pinion mechanism for prismatic link actuation is proposed. Three different modes of operations and two methods for controls are proposed. To validate the kinematic analysis of this configuration a MATLAB model is developed. To compare the numerical and experimental micro-manipulations two test cases are designed and results are compared.

- **Authors:** Himanshu V Vairagade, Vivek Gurve, Neema Amish Ukani, Saurabh S. Chakole
- **Abstract:** Parallel Manipulators are one of the trending re- search topics in robotics. Due to its high structural stiffness and positional accuracy, their applications in industries are rapidly increasing. An important parallel manipulator is the 3-RPS manipulator introduced by Hunt. Since there has been enormous research carried out in the study characteristics of this 
manipulator. In recent years, many novel applications were proposed for 3-RPS. The understanding of kinematics, dynamics, and control methodologies lays a foundation of research and development. In recent years, this manipulator has been used for many novel applications.

### 4. [Solenoidal Valve Actuation System for Four-Stroke IC Engine ](https://www.rame.org.in/pdf/papers6/issue1/v6paper1.html)
- **Authors:** Vivek Gurve, Larwin Ukey, Lokesh Nagtode, Amit Meshram, Anup Naktode, Sudhanshu Gaikwad, Gyanprakash Yadav, Hemant Bansod.
- **Abstract:**  There is a huge competition between manufacturers to make advancement in engine technology. However, one component has stayed unaltered in the internal combustion engine advancement i.e., the camshaft has been the essential methods for controlling the valve actuation and timing, and therefore impact the overall performance of the vehicle.
The issue in utilizing camshafts is being significant power wastage in accelerating and decelerating the parts of the valve train. The friction of camshafts, springs, cam belts and
so on, likewise denies us of valuable power and declines efficiency not to mention contributing to wear and tear. It is a well-known fact that in the event that valves could be controlled autonomously in an Internal Combustion Engine, at that point there would be benefits like increase in power output, decrease in emission, and significant increase in efficiency. Camless innovation is catching the fate of internal combustion engines. In Camless technology valve movement is actuated and controlled by actuators of the electro-mechanical, electro-hydraulic and electromagnetic type.

### 5. [DETAILED DESIGN CALCULATIONS & ANALYSIS OF GO-KART VEHICLE ](https://www.jetir.org/view?paper=JETIR18IC052)
- **Authors:** Avinash Barve
Vivek Gurv, Gaurao Tapre, Arvind Totey.
- **Abstract:**  The main objective of this paper is to give detailed design calculation and analysis of go-kart vehicles parts. Go kart is a four wheel racing vehicle & since there is no suspension and no differential, when both rear tires turn at the same speed. The intention of this paper is modelling and analysis of go-kart vehicle parts according to their design calculation and simulation of parts. The modelling and analysis are performed by using 3D CAD design software tools such as CREO PARAMETRIC 3.0, SOLIDWORKS 
2016 and subjected to simulation using ANSYS WORKBENCH 16.2 etc. where impact analysis was performed in front, rear and lateral directions. Then we observed the flexural rigidity of structure and chassis deformation. The comparison of results of two different materials and then properties with final design is completed. The paper consists of design stresses and deformation result of different components of vehicle parts such as stub axle and stub arm of steering system, and temperature analysis of disc brake. Based on the result obtained from these test the design is modified accordingly.
- **Keywords:** Simulation, Design calculation, modelling.
