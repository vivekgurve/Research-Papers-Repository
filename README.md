## Papers Included

### 1. [Drone View Segmentation: Deep Learning and Transfer Insights](https://github.com/your-repository-link/29.+IJISAE_Vivek+Gurve_DM.pdf)
- **Authors:** Vivek Gurve, Gunjan Singh, Dr. Shilpa Gite, Dr. K. Nandhini, Santosh Borde
- **Abstract:**  This project focuses on the development and application of Deep Learning techniques for Aerial Image Transfer Learning and Segmentation. Leveraging a UNet-based deep learning model with preconfigured weights, the main goal is to obtain high-quality aerial image segmentation, especially for drone-captured photos, for a range of applications including infrastructure evaluation and environmental monitoring. Semantic Drone Data set is a carefully chosen source data set of high quality Drone Aerial Images and matching masks is used to train model. Transfer learning is employ on the target dataset to adapt the model for segmentation tasks in a simulated environment with QGroundControl, PX4Autopilot, and the Gazebo simulator. This simulation-based approach enables the evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance in various scenarios, enhancing its robustness and generalization capabilities. Additionally, the 
generation of a self-captured data set through the simulation environment, emphasizes the integration of synthetic data into the pipeline. The outcome of this project not only contributes to advancing image segmentation in drone-based applications but also explores the effectiveness of Transfer Learning in adapting models to novel environments, fostering advancements in the broader field of computer vision for Unmanned Aerial Systems.

### 2. [Design and Fabrication of 3-RPS Robot - Rack and Pinion Mechanism](https://github.com/your-repository-link/Research-Paper-IEEE-Final.pdf)
- **Authors:** Himanshu V Vairagade, Vivek Gurve, Neema Amish Ukani, Sandeep Sonaskar, Saurabh S. Chakole
- **Abstract:** Parallel Manipulator is one of the trending research topics in the field of robotics. Recently, the 3-RPS parallel manipulator is widely being used for novel applications. Conventionally, the prismatic actuation is implemented using pneumatic drives. In this paper, a rack and pinion mechanism for prismatic link actuation is proposed. Three different modes of operations and two methods for controls are proposed. To validate the kinematic analysis of this configuration a MATLAB model is developed. To compare the numerical and experimental micro-manipulations two test cases are designed and results are compared.

- **Authors:** Himanshu V Vairagade, Vivek Gurve, Neema Amish Ukani, Saurabh S. Chakole
- **Abstract:** Parallel Manipulators are one of the trending re- search topics in robotics. Due to its high structural stiffness and positional accuracy, their applications in industries are rapidly increasing. An important parallel manipulator is the 3-RPS manipulator introduced by Hunt. Since there has been enormous research carried out in the study characteristics of this 
manipulator. In recent years, many novel applications were proposed for 3-RPS. The understanding of kinematics, dynamics, and control methodologies lays a foundation of research and development. In recent years, this manipulator has been used for many novel applications.

### 4. [DETAILED DESIGN CALCULATIONS & ANALYSIS OF GO-KART VEHICLE ](https://github.com/your-repository-link/Research-Paper-IEEE-Final.pdf)
- **Authors:** Himanshu V Vairagade, Vivek Gurve, Neema Amish Ukani, Sandeep Sonaskar, Saurabh S. Chakole.
- **Abstract:**  The main objective of this paper is to give detailed design calculation and analysis of go-kart vehicles parts. Go kart is a four wheel racing vehicle & since there is no suspension and no differential, when both rear tires turn at the same speed. The intention of this paper is modelling and analysis of go-kart vehicle parts according to their design calculation and simulation of parts. The modelling and analysis are performed by using 3D CAD design software tools such as CREO PARAMETRIC 3.0, SOLIDWORKS 
2016 and subjected to simulation using ANSYS WORKBENCH 16.2 etc. where impact analysis was performed in front, rear and lateral directions. Then we observed the flexural rigidity of structure and chassis deformation. The comparison of results of two different materials and then properties with final design is completed. The paper consists of design stresses and deformation result of different components of vehicle parts such as stub axle and stub arm of steering system, and temperature analysis of disc brake. Based on the result obtained from these test the design is modified accordingly.
- **Keywords:** Simulation, Design calculation, modelling.
